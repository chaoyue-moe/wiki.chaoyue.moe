# Chaoyue.Moe Wiki Project 宣言
我们的目标是为超越制造一个完全真正属于她的平台.
超越将作为该平台的最终拥有者, 并具有最高管理权限. 她将有权终止整个项目的运作.

我们将在这个平台上以图片, 文本, 视频等各种多媒体的形式记录超越成长路上的点点滴滴. 内容包括但不限于超越官方释放出来的图片, 视频, 广告, 杂志封面, 访谈, 微博语录, 活动记录, 大事记等内容, 也将包括各大粉丝组团以及在微博, B站, 知乎, 虎扑, DOKI等各个平台上创造和传播的超越内容, 以及线下活动时拍摄的照片, 应援时制作的横幅, 明信片, 福袋等设计作品. 我们期望所能建立一个可以存储和管理这些电子资料的wiki平台. 
平台最终成品可参考东方project wiki平台, THBWiki(https://thwiki.cc/%E9%A6%96%E9%A1%B5). 

技术方面, 初期倾向于采用mediawiki的开源方案进行建站工作, 目标上线地址 https://wiki.chaoyue.moe/

# Chaoyue.Moe Wiki Project Announcement
Our Target is to build a pure chaoyue platform.
Chaoyue will be only one who owns the platform at all. Chaoyue has the highest authority for the platform's management. She can stop the whole project as she wishes.

The first milestone for us is to build a wiki system to record what happened to chaoyue and ourselves. Every single, daily thing is valuable. These may include pictures, videos, magazine's e-copy, music, speech by chaoyue, and activity banners, cards, lucky bags designed and used by fans. It's history. It's youth and memories. It's record of our life with the influence of chaoyue. We don't only attract by the face of that woman. We get power from the smile. We see ourselves in her eyes. It's our education and humanities to chose her as that woman. It's not you and me but the essence of the world and our civilization making her that girl.

The target site prepared for this wiki project is https://wiki.chaoyue.moe/ 
A good reference for the wiki should be Toho Project Wiki Project(THBWiki, 东方project wiki项目). https://thwiki.cc/%E9%A6%96%E9%A1%B5

Further plan will be collected and discussed.    
Thanks for your reading.
